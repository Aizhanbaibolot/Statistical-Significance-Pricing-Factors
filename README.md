# **Statistical Significance - Pricing Factors**
### Project Overview <p>
The purpose of this  project was to clean and analyze raw housing data, identifiy the factors affecting home prices using multiple statistical tests(A/B testing), pivot tables in Excel, and make recommendations based on the analysis. I analyzed 2 factors:
  * houses with fireplace vs without
  * houses with more than 2 garage cars vs with 1 or 0 garage car 
## Business objective
* Analyze factors affecting home prices
* Recommendations based on analysis
  
## Hypotheses
  * Hypothesis 1: Does the houses with a fireplace cost more than the ones without.
  * Hypothesis 2: Does the houses with 2 garage cars cost more than the ones with 1 or 0 garage car.

## Data Analyzed
  * Total 1460 houses.
  * 690 houses without fireplace while 770 with fireplace
  * 450 houses with 1 or 0 garage car while 1010 with more than 2 garage cars.
  * Conducted statistical analyses(t-test) to see if there is any statistically significant difference between them.
 
## Analysis of Hypothesis 1

* There is a statistically significant difference between the prices of the houses with and without fireplace 
* Average house price with fireplace $216 400, whereas without fireplace $141 000 
* Average difference $75 400

## Analysis of Hypothesis 2

* There is a statistically difference between the prices of the houses with 1 or 0 garage car versus more than 2 garage cars
* Average house price with more than 2 garage cars $206 500 whereas less than 2 garage cars $123 700
* Average difference $82 800


## Recommendations

The statistical analyses showed that
  * The price of the houses with fireplace is more than the ones without.
  * The price of the houses with more than 2 garage cars is more than the houses with 1 or 0 garage car.
Consider the options of extending garage cars and adding fireplaces.


 
## Result
*	Developed dashboard to assist shareholders within an investment bank in determining factors that drive housing prices and how they should allocate dollars earmarked for investment into mortgage-backed securities. 
*	Dashboard data was supported through t-tests run on housing price factors showing statistical significance.
*	Tech: Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint
