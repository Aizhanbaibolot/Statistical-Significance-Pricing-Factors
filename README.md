## Strategy 1

* Assume 4300 cars instead of 4000, exclude cars model year 2016, purchase more cars model year 2019
* Increase In Net Revenue Of $6.6M
  
### These are the Top 10 and Bottom 10 Cars recommended:

## Strategy 2

* Increase cost of the car rentals by 15%
* Costs remain same, gross revenue $60M, net revenue $26.5M, which makes difference of $8M.
  
## Strategy 3

* Assume decrease in car cost by 8% and insurance cost by 5%
* Gross revenue remains same, costs $30.5M, net revenue $22M, increase in net revenue  of $2.5M
  
  
## Recommendations

Based on the analysis above I would recommend first and second strategies which are to increase number of cars and/or 
to increase car rental price, and which will make difference in net revenue of $6.6M and $10M consequentially.
